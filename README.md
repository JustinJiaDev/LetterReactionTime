# Letter Reaction Time

Compare the legibility of different typefaces.

1. A random term appears on the screen.
2. The tester needs to recognize the *part of speech* of the term by tapping **V** or **N**.
3. The app records the response time and correctness of the answer.

## Features (For Researchers)

Researchers can configure typefaces and terms used in the app.

1. Add more terms in `VocabSources.plist`.
2. Add more typefaces in `FontDescriptions.plist` (can be more than 2).
 
The app will output a plist file after a test.

## How to Use (For Testers)

- Press **V** if the term displayed on the screen is a verb.
- Press **N** if the term displayed on the screen is a noun.
- Press **B** to continue.
