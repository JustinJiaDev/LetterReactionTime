# Letter Reaction Time

This program is designed to test fonts' readability and legibility.

After the tester pressed a button, a random term in a random font will appear on the screen. The tester needs to recognize the **Part of Speech** of the term as soon as possible. Then the tester needs to repeat this progress until every term has appeared once.

## Features (To Researchers)

You can change the fonts you want to test and terms you want to use in this program.

1. You can change the terms this program used in ```VocabSources.plist```.
2. You can change the fonts this program used in ```FontDescriptions.plist```. You can have more than two fonts.

This program will output a plist file after a tester finished his test.

## How to Use (To Testers)

- Tap **V** if you think the term displayed on the screen is a verb.
- Tap **N** if you think the term displayed on the screen is a noun.
- Tap **B** to display the next term.
