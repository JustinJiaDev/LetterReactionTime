Letter Reaction Time
===========================
In the test, there are different terms in different fonts that will show up randomly. The tester need to recognize what part of speech the terms are.
This program will output a plist file at the end of the test.

##Features

**You can specify the fonts you want to test and the terms you want to use in this program. Just replace the default settings stored in the plist files**

1. **VocabSources.plist** You can add your terms here. Note: Noun terms under Nouns array, verb terms under Verbs array.
2. **FontDescriptions.plist** You can add your fonts here. Note: You can add multiply fonts.

##How to use it

**Please use hot keys**

Tap **V** if you think the term showed on the screen is a verb.
Tap **N** if you think the term showed on the screen is a noun.
Tap **B** to tell the program to show the next term.
